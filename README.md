## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS (5 pts)**: Added rules for several selectors and classes, including:
  - `p`, `li` - increased font size, changed font family
  - `th`, `td` - added padding on the right side so that columns appear spaced out
  - `.two-columns` - set the width to be 50% so that two boxes are side-by-side and have equal width
  - `header` - centered text, added padding, changed background color
  - `footer` - centered text, added padding, changed display to `flex` so elements appear side-by-side
  - ... and more (see `styles.css`)
- **Experimented with semantic HTML tags (5 pts)**: Used more than the 2 required semantic tags, including:
  - `nav` - used for navigation bar
  - `header` - used for heading and title on each page
  - `section` - used to group together a general group of text and related content
  - `main` - used to contain the main sections on the page
  - `footer` - used at the bottom of the page to contain contact information
  - `figure` - used to group an image and figure caption
  - `article` - used to hold the form, which is independent content from the rest of the page

### Design Achievements
